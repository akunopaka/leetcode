# My Solution to Problems from Leetcode.com <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZECV5BL5Y6aM1M4Szj/giphy.gif" width="50">

Leetcode.com is a website that provides programming challenges to help developers improve their coding skills. I have been using this site to help me improve my coding skills, and I have come up with my own solutions to some of the problems. My approach is to first break down the problem into smaller pieces. Then, I look up the different methods and algorithms that can be used to solve the problem. Once I have a better understanding of the problem and the available solutions, I try to find the most efficient way to solve the problem.

I often use the divide and conquer approach, where I break down the problem into smaller subproblems and solve them individually. This helps reduce the complexity of the problem, making it easier to understand and solve. I also use the brute force method to solve the problem, which involves trying every possible solution until the correct one is found.

To test my solutions, I use the in-built test cases provided by Leetcode.com. This allows me to quickly check if my code is doing what it's supposed to do. I also use the debugging feature to check for errors in my code.

Overall, my approach to solving problems from Leetcode.com has **helped me improve my coding skills and become a better programmer**. I am constantly improving my coding skills by trying out different solutions and learning from my mistakes.
